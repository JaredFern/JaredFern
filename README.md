I am a first-year doctoral student in the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University where I am advised by Yonatan Bisk and Emma Strubell.

My research interests are primarily in machine learning and natural language processing. Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Northwestern University
